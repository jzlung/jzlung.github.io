# FE Intz

# General Tips
- Be very comfortable writing framework-less HTML, CSS, and JS, knowledge of DOM.


- http://davidshariff.com/blog/preparing-for-a-front-end-web-development-interview-in-2017/ is the most holistic guide I've seen for FE Int Prep. I didn’t follow it down to a tee myself but if you do you will have success. You do need to know all these concepts. 


- Hit up your connections for referrals. If none, start sending out applications on web pages/LinkedIn/AngelList/StackOverflow, what ever you can. 


- Remember to push out talks with your high priority targets as much as possible, reasonably drag it out. Big companies are lenient and don’t care when you start, smaller companies have timelines themselves though. 


- Slam as much interviews as possible (take on all the companies that hit you up but you aren’t that interested in to start building up fitness). It’s just a numbers game, soon you’ll be acclimatized to the FE interviewing game. 


- Defer any talk of salary until the verbal offer is made! Very important. The recruiter might hound you for a number for “expectations” purposes or whatever. Deflect with things like you are “flexible / looking at the whole package / blah blah”. No need to talk numbers until both parties are ready to make it happen. 


- Do not talk to certain 3rd party recruiting companies, like TopTech Ventures or Skyrocket Ventures. They are spammy as fuck and don’t have great opportunities. In addition, they might use carrot-stick tactics like “Oh, we have connections with Airbnb, Groupon, ${OTHER_BIG_NAME}” but after you start talking to them, they’ll deflect and offer up some lesser name companies instead. 


# Timeline

**Starting your Search**

- Open up all your recruiting channels
  - **LinkedIn** Besides updating your profile, go to Settings > Privacy and turn on the option that lets recruiters know you are job seeking. That will put you into their searches and really hyperjump your hits. 
    - Optimize your Skills. Look at example job postings on LinkedIn, there’s a section that talks about how you fare skill-wise compared to other applicants. Figure out what skills you are missing and add them to your profile if applicable to boost yourself to >90%. 
  - **AngelList**, sign up and turn on. Then, if/when you get an invite to A-List, join that. It is a fast-track version of AngelList where they come to you. Requires a short coding challenge with quiz and algo coding. 
    - AngelList also useful for scoping out salary ranges for a job, look at the posting
    - They also send digests of hot companies
  - If you’re really hurting for hits, you can try out platforms such as Hired, Vettery, etc. 
  - **DO NOT** talk to any headhunters!!!!!! 
  - If you have a personal site, definitely update that to optimize the contact workflow
- Set up a spreadsheet to track your search. Log interview questions, recruiter contacts,  progress, thoughts, to help yourself improve. 
  - Prioritize all the companies. More on that below. 
- [Breakout List](https://breakoutlist.com/) is also a good resource on which companies are going to “make it”, and thus are strong start-up bets. 

Hit up your connections for referrals. If none, start sending out applications on web pages/LinkedIn/AngelList/StackOverflow, what ever you can. 

Remember to push out talks with your high priority targets as much as possible, reasonably drag it out. Big companies are lenient and don’t care when you start, smaller companies have timelines themselves though. 

**Months out**

- Do the questions in my doc
- Build UI widgets on codepen
- Implement lodash/underscore utilities
- Do leetcode

**Week or days before each interview**

- Raid the company's Glassdoor int q's (search variations of Front, Front-End, Web Developer, UI Engineer, etc) -- this is most important and has passed me so many interviews. The larger the company, the more they tend to reuse their question bank.
- Do a bit of research on the company and answer the question “So why are you interested in ${COMPANY_NAME}?”. Should align with questions such as “What are you looking for in a new role/team/company?”. 

**Before your first Interview**

- Prep your pitch and 2-3 concrete work experience anecdotes -- you will use them for every interview. They should be examples of interesting projects that demonstrate your technical strengths and interests. 
- Answer the following questions (the anecdotes may be useful here): 
  - “Tell me about what you've been up to.”
    - Most common one, will be asked by recruiters and interviewers alike. This is your elevator pitch noted above. Take no more than 20-30 secs to sum up your experience and recent projects, mentorship/leadership
  - "Tell me about an interesting project you worked on.”
    - They’re looking for a technically challenge, and how did you overcome it. 
  - “Why are you looking for a change / looking elsewhere / leaving ${CURRENT_COMPANY}?”
    - The answer is 99% always GROWTH. Don’t talk shit about your current employer, keep it brief and focused on growth. 
  - “What are you looking for in your new role / what aspects are important to you (e.g. team size, culture, projects)?”
    - Dependent on you, make sure you know what you want out of life and if the team can give it to you. Should somewhat correlate with “Why are you leaving?” 

**During Interview**

- Remember interviewer(s)’ name(s)
- Take note of how interview responds to your soft question answers and anecdotes. Pay attention to what details they liked, what follow-up questions they asked, how they respond, etc. 




 Answer the questions, “", "Tough challenge and how you overcame", ", etc. Refine your anecdotes with each interview ().
They love mentor/leadership experience

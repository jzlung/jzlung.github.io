================
This is the personal website of Jerry Lung. I built this from scratch, no CSS templates (other than Bootstrap's scripts). I got tired of the huge, unmanageable mess that I had little foothold on that is the Bootstrap codebase. I decided that I should know exactly what each div does and rebuild the site to be minimal and learn all the front end principles from scratch. 

Please let me know if it's not mobile responsive.
